# Introduction to Edge Impulse X Rubik Pi

Edge Impulse is a ML development platform focused on making it easy to build, train, optimize, and deploy ML models directly on edge device. 
To use Edge Impulse, I recommend these three different workflows- Beginner Dev, Average Dev, and Expert Dev. Each of these workflows are explained in their respective folders.

To test these workflows, the sample project I will be building is an **ASL Classification Task**
- Combined dataset of three publicly available ASL image datasets- 60k images across 28 classes (A-Z, Nothing, Space)
- Images resized to 160X160
- Classification model was based on MobileNetV2 architecture, leveraging transfer learning
